This is the personal blog for Geoff Davis. I'm a programmer/sysadmin/network
admin/toolsmith/whatever at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

I'm probably about as close to a full-stack engineer as you can get, from
digging holes in the desert to install seismometers, to writing datalogger
importing code, to running the backhaul data networks.
